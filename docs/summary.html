Quantities of light
==============================================================
## Flux
is a measure of how much light passes through a surface (or boundary) in a given amount of time. Imagine a bounding sphere around a lightbulb that emits equally in all directions. The light that passes through the sphere is the flux. We formalize flux as
$$
\Phi(A) \; \; \left[ \frac{J}{s} = W \right]
$$

## Irradiance
is a measure of how much power from light is recieved per unit area. Think of sunlight hitting your skin.

- If you stand in direct sunlight, you feel more warmth because more light energy is hitting your skin per second $\rightarrow$ higher irradiance.
- If you stand in the shade, you feel less warmth because less light energy is hitting your skin per second $\rightarrow$ lower irradiance.
- If you use a magnifying glass to focus sunlight on your skin, you feel a burning sensation because the light energy is concentrated on a smaller area $\rightarrow$ higher irradiance.

As irradiance is a measure of power per unit area, it essentially breaks down to flux per unit area and can thus be formalized as
$$
E(x) = \frac{d\Phi(A)}{dA} \; \; \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]
$$

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="graphs/irradiance.png" alt="Flux Visualization"></div>

## Radiosity
is a measure of how much power is emitted by a surface per unit area. As this is the inverse of irradiance, its formalization is equivalent. Think of a lightbulb emitting light in all directions. The radiosity is the power emitted by the lightbulb per unit area of the lightbulb's surface. We have
$$
B(x) = \frac{d\Phi(A)}{dA} \; \; \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]
$$

## Radiant Intensity
is a measure of how much light is emitted in a given direction. It is the flux emitted by a light source per unit solid angle. It tells us how focused or spread out the light is. Think of the following example

- The sun emits a huge amount of power (flux), but it spreads in all directions, so the radiant intensity is moderate.
- A laser pointer emits a small amount of power, but it is focused in a very narrow beam, so the radiant intensity is high.

We have
$$
I(\omega) = \frac{d\Phi(\omega)}{d\omega} \; \; \left[ \frac{W}{sr} \right]
$$

where $\omega$ is the solid angle of the beam.

## Radiance
measures how much light travels in a specific direction from a specific surface area. It is the most fundamental quantity in computer graphics as it directly corresponds to what our eyes and cameras percieve as brightness. Think of the following

- If you look directly into a flashlight, it appears very bright (high radiance).
- If you look atht the beam from the side, it appears dimmer (lower radiance).
- The flashlight still emits the same amount of light (flux does not change), but its brightness depends on the viewing angle.

In other words, the radiance is radiant intensity weighted by the cosine of the angle between the direction of the light and the normal of the surface. We have
$$
L(x, \omega) = \frac{d^2\Phi(\omega)}{dA \cdot d\omega \cdot \cos(\theta)} \; \; \left[ \frac{W}{m^2 \cdot sr} \right]
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the normal of the surface and the direction of the light.

Lamberts Cosine Law
==============================================================

Lamberts Cosine Law is a fundamental prinziple in computer graphics. It describes how light interacts with diffuse surfaces, which reflect light evenly in all directions.

The brightness of a surface depends not only on the insensity of the light source but also on the angle at which the light hits the surface.

- When light strikes a surface perpendicularly, it appears brightest.
- When light hits at an angle, it spreads out over a larger area, making each small part of the surface recieve less light.
- When light is at a grazing angle, the surface recieves very little light, making it appear darker.

Shape Representation
==============================================================

## Parametric Representation
Imagine you are drawing a curve on a piece of paper. One way to describe this curve is by listing a series of points $(x,y)$ that make up the curve. But what if you could describe the whole curve using just a single equation? This is where **parametric representations** come in.

Instead of directly describing the curve as $y = f(x)$, we introduce an extra variable - let's call it $t$ (a parameter) - and define both $x$ and $y$ in terms of $t$:
$$
x = x(t), y = y(t)
$$
As $t$ changes, it traces out the curve. Think of $t$ as a slider that moves along the curve, generating points.

In 3D, we can extend the idea further by using two parameters, $u$ and $v$, to define a **surface**:
$$
x = x(u,v), y = y(u,v), z = z(u,v)
$$

**Parametric Circle** is represented by the formula:
$$
p(t) = r(\cos(t), \sin(t)) \; \; t \in [0, 2\pi]
$$

<iframe src="graphs/parametric_circle_slider.html" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

**Parametric Sphere** is represented by the formula:
$$
p(u,v) = r(\cos(u)\cos(v), \sin(u)\cos(v), \sin(v)) \\
(u,v) \in [0, 2\pi] \times [\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]
$$

## Implicit Representation
Imagine you're trying to describe a circle on a piece of paper. One way is using the equation:
$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$
This equation doesn't give you individual points like parametric equations do. Instead, it defines a condition: any point $(x,y)$ that satisfies this equation lies on the circle.

This is the essence of implicit representations - instead of describing how to move along a shape, we describe a rule that points must follow.

**Implicit Circle** is represented by the formula:
$$
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - r^2 = 0
$$

**Implicit Sphere** is represented by the formula:
$$
f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2 = 0
$$

## Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
CSG is a technique for combining simple shapes to create more complex ones. It's like building with Lego blocks - you start with basic shapes and combine them in different ways to create more intricate structures. Given shapes in
implicit form, we can combine their representative functions using boolean set operations to create new shapes. Remember that a shapes boundary is represented by the points that evaluate to zero under its implicit function. Points inside of a shape evaluate to $<0$ and points outside to $>0$. We
can therefore model the following set operations:

- **Union**: Combine two shapes by taking the minimum of their functions.
     $$
     f_{\text{union}}(x) = \min(f_1(x), f_2(x))
     $$
- **Intersection**: Combine two shapes by taking the maximum of their functions.
     $$
     f_{\text{intersection}}(x) = \max(f_1(x), f_2(x))
     $$
- **Difference**: Subtract one shape from another by taking the maximum of the first and the negative of the second.
     $$
     f_{\text{difference}}(x) = \max(f_1(x), -f_2(x))
     $$

Polygonal Meshes
==============================================================
## Manifolds
A manifold in the context of polygonal meshes is a surface that locally resembles a Euclidean space, meaning every small region around a point on the surface behaves like a flat plane or a half-plane. This concept is fundamental in geometric modeling and computer graphics,
as it ensures that a 3D model has well-defined and predictable surface properties.

A $2$-manifold is a surface where every point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to a disk. In simpler terms, if you zoom into any point on the surface, it should look like a flat plane. This means that the surface is continuous and has no holes or self-intersections.
We characterize a mesh with the following types of manifolds:

- **Closed Manifold**: Every edge in the mesh is shared by exactly two faces. This means that the mesh ecloses a volume (it is watertight) and has no boundary. An example would be a sphere or torus.
- **Manifold with boundary**: Every edge is shared by either one or two faces. Edges that are shared by only one face form a boundary loop. An example would be an open cylinder or a disk.
- **Non-Manifold**: There are edges that are shared by more than two faces. This leads to vertices that are connected in a way that does not create a locally flat surface. In other words, a non-manifold mesh represents geometry that can not exist in the real 3D space. Non manifold meshes should be avoided in practice as they can be problemaic for various usecases like
     - Rendering
     - Fluid simulation
     - Boolean operations
     - 3D printing

## Mesh Triangulation
Triangulation is the process of dividing a polygon into triangles. This is important because many algorithms and rendering techniques work with triangles as the basic building block. Triangles are simple to work with and have nice properties like being planar and convex. Further, they always contain exactly 3 vertices and 3 edges, simplifying storage. 

Appearance Modelling
==============================================================
Appearance modeling is about how objects look when light interacts with them. It helps create realistic digital images by defining how materials reflect, absorb, or scatter light.

## BRDF
A BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) is a mathematical function that describes how light is reflected at an opaque surface. The **reflection equation** is given by
$$
\int_{H^2} f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o) \cos(\theta_i) d\omega_i = L_o(x, \omega_o)
$$

Intuitively the reflection equation states that the light reflected in a specific direction $\omega_o$ from a point $x$ on a surface is the sum of the light reflected from all incoming directions $\omega_i$ weighted by the BRDF and the cosine of the angle between the normal of the surface and the incoming light. The integration volume $H^2$ is a hemisphere, thereby capturing all possible directions of incoming light above the surface.

## Lambertian Diffuse BRDF
The Lambertian BRDF is the simplest BRDF model and is used to describe perfectly diffuse surfaces. A lambertian reflection is isotropic, meaning it reflects light equally in all directions (the BRDF function is constant).
We can deduce

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    L_o(x, \omega_o) &= \int_{H^2} f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o) \cos(\theta_i) d\omega_i \\
                     & = \int_{H^2} f_r \cos(\theta_i) d\omega_i\\
                     & = f_r \int_{H^2} \cos(\theta_i) d\omega_i\\
                     & = f_r E(x)
                        
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

## Ideal Specular Reflection
An ideal specular reflection can be understood intuitively by thinking about a perfect mirror. Imagine light rays hitting a perfect, smooth surface (like a mirror). These rays reflect off the surface in a single, well-defined direction, following **Snell's Law**:
$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$
which means that the **angle of incidence** $\theta_i$ is equal to the **angle of reflection** $\theta_r$. Since the surface is perfectly smooth, all rays that come in at a given angle will reflect in exactly the same direction, creating a sharp, clear reflection (in particular, there is no scattering).

## Ideal Specular Refraction
Now imagine you are looking at a straw in a glass of water. The straw appears bent at the water's surface, even though it's actually straight. This bending effect happens because light changes direction when it moves from one medium to another
(like from air to water). In **ideal specular refraction**, light passes through a perfectly smooth and transparent surface (like glass or water) without scattering. Instead, it follows Snell's Law, which dictates how much the light bends. We have:
$$
\eta_1 \sin(\theta_i) = \eta_2 \sin(\theta_t)
$$
where $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence, and $\theta_t$ is the angle of transmission.
